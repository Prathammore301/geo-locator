## 📌 About This Project
**Geo-Locator App** is a React-based web application that allows users to **fetch their current geolocation** (latitude & longitude) using the browser's Geolocation API.  

❗ **Note:** The current API is not returning location data because **Google Cloud API has an unpaid balance.** Once the payment is cleared, the API will work fine. Alternatively, you can replace the API key with a new one.

## ⚠️ API Issue & Solution  
📌 **Why is the location not working?**  
The Google Maps API is not returning location data because:  
1. **The Google Cloud API associated with this project has an unpaid balance.**  
2. **You need to replace the API key with a new one.**  

📌 **How to Fix?**  
- **Option 1:** Pay the pending balance on your Google Cloud billing account.  
- **Option 2:** Generate a new API key from the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and update it in your \`.env\` file.
